# MC Structure Builder
### Build structures and place them in Minecraft using commands

This is a tool for building structures for Minecraft.

Yes, you _can_ use a structure block, but those are hard to use with commands.
Whereas, these structures can be downloaded as a `.mcfunction` file and put into a datapack.

## I don't see all of MC's blocks.
I don't support all of Minecraft's blocks yet. Meanwhile, you can [create a pull request](https://github.com/seattleowl/mc-structure-builder/compare) to add more blocks. I'll try to add all the pull requests that add blocks.

## Can I save my creation?
Yes, just press CTRL+S (CMD+S Mac).
